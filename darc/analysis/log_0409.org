* finer feature construction

up til 04-02, root has form="</s>" upos="ROOT", missing nodes has form=""
upos="_", and unknown fields are treated as missing. the model cannot distinguish
missing nodes from nodes with missing info.

distinguish three special cases:

|         | dumb | root     | obsc |
|---------+------+----------+------|
| form    |      | </s>     | _    |
| upostag |      | ROOT     | _    |
| feats   |      | Root=Yes | _    |

in =d+r+o2=, ignore obsc-feat and set obsc-upos embedding to zero, since they can
never be trained.

** conclusion

finally remembered why i disliked relu: unnatural hyperspace.

normal distribution is probably not good for tanh. use orthogonal for dense and
uniform for embeddings.

* try dropout on embeddings

** conclusion

very promising. try again with lemm emb.
